# Carlisle_Borough_Transportation_Study

The Carlisle Borough Transportation Study is a part of my ongoing data analytics internship. It is a comprehensive analysis and modeling project aimed at improving road safety and infrastructure for vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians in the Carlisle Borough area. This project employs a data-driven approach, utilizing Python for web scraping, replication techniques, and predictive modeling. Here's an overview of the key components of this study:

### Crash Data Analysis and Trends Identification

We conduct in-depth analysis and modeling of crash data to identify trends and patterns on the road. By analyzing historical crash data, we aim to pinpoint specific areas and conditions that pose higher risks to road users. This data-driven approach allows us to make informed decisions about potential safety improvements.

### Network Analysis of Cycling and Pedestrian Infrastructures

Our project assesses the cycling and pedestrian infrastructures within Carlisle Borough. Using Python and network analysis techniques, we evaluate the efficiency and safety of these infrastructures. This analysis helps us identify areas that may require enhancements to promote safer and more accessible transportation options for cyclists and pedestrians.

### Predictive Models for Crash Rate Forecasting

We develop predictive models to see the effects of infrastructure on incident rates, especially among vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians. 

### Informative Charts and Infographics

To effectively communicate our findings and recommendations, we produce informative charts and infographics. These visual representations of data help educate policymakers and the public on automobile safety issues, enabling informed decision-making and promoting awareness.
